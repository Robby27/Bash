Configuring Key Based Login
Setup ssh in every node such that they can communicate with one another without any prompt for password.

# su hadoop 
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa 
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tutorialspoint@hadoop-master 
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hadoop_tp1@hadoop-slave-1 
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub hadoop_tp2@hadoop-slave-2 
$ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
